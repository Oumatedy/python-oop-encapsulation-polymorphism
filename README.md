# 🧠 Python OOP Assignment

This repository contains two mini projects demonstrating **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python, including:

- ✅ Class creation
- 🔁 Inheritance
- 🔐 Encapsulation
- 🎭 Polymorphism

---

## 🏗️ Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class
A custom class for a `Smartphone` that inherits from a base `Device` class.

### Features:
- Uses a constructor to initialize each phone
- Encapsulates camera and storage
- Overrides the `specs()` method to show polymorphism
- Includes a `take_photo()` method

---

## 🎭 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
Demonstrates polymorphism using a base `Vehicle` class and 3 subclasses:

- `Car` → 🚗 Driving
- `Plane` → ✈️ Flying
- `Boat` → 🚢 Sailing

All subclasses implement their own `move()` method, and a common test function shows polymorphism in action.

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python main.py
